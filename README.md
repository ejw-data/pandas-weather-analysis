Analysis of humidity, temperature, cloudiness, and precipation data from over 1000 randomly selected cities from around the world.  Randomly selected cities were obtained by using the citipy package and weather data for each city was obtained from API calls to OpenWeather.  Analysis was performed by using Pandas and Matplotlib.
